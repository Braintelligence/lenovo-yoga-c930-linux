## Summary

* Minimum BIOS version: **8GCN32WW**
* Minimum kernel version: **5.1-rc1** (see [Older kernels](#older-kernels) otherwise)

## Fixes

### Speaker
This laptop has 5.1 speaker configuration with only Front Left and Front Right working by default. This hack can enable another one (Front Center or LFE, not sure):

**NOTE:** This hack can make headphone sound quieter.

* Install `alsa-tools-gui` package (`alsa-utils` in some distributions)
* Run `hdajackretask`
* Set "Show unconnected pins" tick in "Options"
* Set pin with ID `0x17` to "Override" with "Dock Headphone"
* Click "Install boot override" and enter sudo password
* Reboot

You can also apply fix immediately but it will most likely fail due to soundcard is in use by `pulseaudio`. If you want to apply fix without rebooting you need to stop pulseaudio first.

It seems like to fix this issue either Lenovo should release BIOS update with correct pin mappings or some model definition should be added to snd-hda-intel module like it was done for another Lenovo laptops with surround sound. See [Lenovo Y530 example](https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1596068).

**TODO:** File ALSA bug

## Notes
### Older kernels
Kernel versions prior to **5.1-rc1** have a bug in `ideapad-laptop` module preventing wireless interfaces from being enabled.
```
$ rfkill list
0: ideapad_wlan: Wireless LAN
	Soft blocked: no
	Hard blocked: yes
1: ideapad_bluetooth: Bluetooth
	Soft blocked: yes
	Hard blocked: yes
```
If your devices are hard blocked by rfkill there are two ways of dealing with this:

Recommended: cherrypick [this commit](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/67133c6d99ef0d8917f764a9a70039b5e78d5e71) to desired branch and build a whole kernel or just `ideapad-laptop` module by yourself.

**TODO:** Guide how to build patched ideapad-laptop

Another solution is to prevent faulty module from being loaded on boot:

**WARNING: This will break lots of ACPI functionality including S3/S4 sleep!** 
```
# sudo modprobe -r ideapad-laptop`
# echo "blacklist ideapad-laptop" | sudo tee -a /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf
```
### Fn lock

F1-F12 row behaviour can be changed in BIOS. 

### Conservation Mode

Conservation mode in some Lenovo laptops will stop the battery from charging above 60% to improve the lifespan of the battery.

Enable:
```
$ echo 1 | sudo tee /sys/bus/platform/drivers/ideapad_acpi/VPC2004:00/conservation_mode
```
Disable:
```
$ echo 0 | sudo tee /sys/bus/platform/drivers/ideapad_acpi/VPC2004:00/conservation_mode
```

**NOTE:** You will still see "Charging" state and estimated time to full while being in Conservation mode.

## FW update
### Battery firmware

I have wiped Windows partitions and installed Fedora right after purchasing this laptop and ensuring latest BIOS version is installed. After some time I've found out that battery stucked on `99% Charging` and never goes `100% Full`. If you're facing the same issue first of all: **DO NOT PANIC**. At least before recharging battery 3-5 full cycles. In my case this helped, the problem is gone.

But there're many similar problems with Lenovo batteries firmware in general ([evidence from year 2014!](http://code.jasonbhill.com/linux/faulty-firmware-in-lenovo-batteries/)) and Lenovo offers [Battery Firmware Update](https://pcsupport.lenovo.com/us/en/products/LAPTOPS-AND-NETBOOKS/YOGA-SERIES/YOGA-C930-13IKB/downloads/DS505955) for C930 too to fix an issue "where the battery capacity abnormal loss then the battery life might be reduced". In my case battery firmware was already updated and some recharge cycles have fixed the problem. But if you're facing some battery issues or just want to be sure about this, here's a guide to update battery firmware without Windows installed:

* Find some WinPE ISO based on latest Windows version. Consider using [MediCat DVD](https://gbatemp.net/threads/medicat-dvd-a-multiboot-linux-dvd.361577/) or [Win10PESE](https://toolslib.net/downloads/viewdownload/255-winpese-x64/).
* Burn ISO to USB flash drive with ```woeusb```. Remember you can't make Windows bootable drives with plain `dd`.
* Mount resulting partition. Create a directory for downloaded drivers.
* Find out your battery vendor:
```
$ upower -i /org/freedesktop/UPower/devices/battery_BAT1 | grep vendor
  vendor:               Celxpert
```
* Download [Energy Manager Driver](https://pcsupport.lenovo.com/us/en/products/LAPTOPS-AND-NETBOOKS/YOGA-SERIES/YOGA-C930-13IKB/downloads/DS503661) (file named `wwe00aae.exe`) and copy it in directory created on a flash drive.
* Download [Battery Firmware Update](https://pcsupport.lenovo.com/us/en/products/LAPTOPS-AND-NETBOOKS/YOGA-SERIES/YOGA-C930-13IKB/downloads/DS505955) matching your battery vendor. Looks like a ZIP file, right? But it's not.
```
$ file yogac930_bat_cpt_201812.zip 
yogac930_bat_cpt_201812.zip: RAR archive data, v5
```
Nice trick, Lenovo! So, `unrar` this archive
`$ unrar x yogac930_bat_cpt_201812.zip . -v`
and copy resulting executable to the flash drive.
* Poweroff laptop, press power button with holded `Fn` key. Choose "Boot menu", load from WinPE partition.
* Install Energy Manager Driver (replace C: with B: in installation paths when needed). Then install Battery Firmware Update.
* Done!
