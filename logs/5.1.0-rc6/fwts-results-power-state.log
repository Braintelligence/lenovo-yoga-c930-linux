Test 1 of 1: S3 power loss during suspend test.
Detecting the power method.
Response to CanSuspend is yes 
User allowed to execute the CanSuspend action

S3 duration = 601.
Change in capacity: 520 mWh 
Loss of 3120.0000 mWh per hour.
The 60050 mWh battery will provide 19.25 hours of suspend time.
FAILED [CRITICAL] ShortSuspendLife24hrs: Test 1, Machine cannot remain suspended
for 1 day.
Note: Accuracy of results are increased with longer sleep delay durations.
pm-suspend returned 0 after 601 seconds.
