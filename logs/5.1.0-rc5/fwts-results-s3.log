FAILED [HIGH] KlogAcpiLidInvertedSwitchEvent: Test 1, HIGH Kernel message: [
414.656788] ACPI: button: The lid device is not compliant to SW_LID.

ADVICE: The ACPI button driver has detected a non compliant LID device switch.
This can occur because the platform reports the lid as closed immediately after
booting or resuming, or because the device never reports open events. The ACPI
button driver has inverted the LID switch event to try to ensure expected
behaviour

Suspend/Resume Timings:
  Could not determine time to suspend.
  Could not determine time to resume.
Completed S3 cycle(s) 
Found 1 errors in kernel log.
PASSED: Test 1, No PM related suspend issues detected.
PASSED: Test 1, No device errors detected.
PASSED: Test 1, No kernel oopses detected.
PASSED: Test 1, No kernel WARN_ON warnings detected.
Found 1 errors and 0 oopses doing 1 suspend/resume cycle(s).
PASSED: Test 1, All suspends took less than 15.00 seconds.
PASSED: Test 1, All resumes took less than 15.00 seconds.
